USE ONLY ALCALINE 1.5V batteries, 
Get 4 batteries, new from the same pack. This is to ensure the same voltages because we are going to put them in parallel.

DO NOT USE ACCUMULATORS NiMH (1.2V), we need 1.5V during the programming phase else too large a voltage difference between 3.3V from USB and 2*Vbat

One micro USB cable

6x 50 ohms resistors will limit current on each led to about 20mA
1x 2K ohms resistor from cpu PB3/D13 pin to base of transistor

an iron (just to open the SB14 and SB9 solder bridges on the nucleo board)

======================================
Justification for the values of the resistors

Current in the leds ? We want 0.02A current in each of the 6 leds total 0.120A, at ~1.85V.

Checking that the transistor will be able to drive the leds in good saturation
We have in datasheet NPN : hFE = 200.
Ibase = (3-0.6)/2000 = 0.0012A 
Icollector = 1.2mA*hFE = 0.240A. OK > 0.120A
OK

What resistor to put in series with the leds for that ?
BC547BTF Saturation voltage at 0.12A ~= 0.15v to 0.2v
which leads to a resistance for each led of R = U/I = (3-0.15-1.85)/0.02 = 50 ohms.

I think it would not be recommended to put all the leds in parallel with a single 8.3333 ohm resistor because of the variations in production, but it should rather work. Would still be below 1/4w
But that would make less wires.


======================================
Checking the firmware and functionality before assembly on the breadboard

Because it happens that PB3/D13 also drives the green led of the nucleo board, you can test the functionality with the nucleo board as it is out of the factory. 
(no resistor, no transistor, no battery, with SB14 and SB9 still closed, no big led, no breadboard).

======================================
To build the circuit with the breadboard, the components and wires:
See doc/schematic.png
See doc/nucleo.png
See doc/open_sb14_sb9.png
Ask if you have no idea how to do that.
